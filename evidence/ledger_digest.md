# Ledger digest (auto-generated -- do not edit; run `python scout.py ledger digest`)

34 tracked ideas. Latest state per idea; full history in ledger.jsonl.

## Known failure modes (kill-code frequency)

Before proposing a candidate, check it against every pattern below.
A candidate that dies like a prior one must say what makes it different.

- **DATA_INSUFFICIENT** x1: The subset that actually supports the inference is too small or unreachable.
- **CIRCULARITY** x1: The endpoint is a re-encoding of the input or of the thing being tested.
- **IDENTIFIABILITY_FAILURE** x1: The design cannot separate the claimed mechanism from a co-varying acquisition, protocol, tool, or population factor in any obtainable cohort.
