# Research charter

## The driver

Medical imaging models sometimes outperform physicians, or predict things
physicians cannot predict at all. When that happens the model is using signal
that is present in the image and that human readers do not knowingly use.
Sometimes that signal is a real biological or physical fact nobody had
articulated. Sometimes it is an artifact of how the data was made.

**The program: decode what medical imaging models have found, and determine
which kind of thing it is.**

Concepts enter here as the *readout language* — a way to say what the model
found — rather than as a supervision constraint imposed in advance. That is
the inverse of standard concept-bottleneck work and it is the more interesting
direction.

### The deliverable

**Every candidate must end in a sentence a radiologist could read and either
agree or disagree with.**

Of the form: *the model is using X*, where X is a named anatomical,
physiological, or physical thing. Not "the model is not using the scanner."
Not "performance drops when we ablate region R." A positive statement, in
words a physician already has.

That sentence is the point. Everything else is what makes it credible.

### The three rungs

State which rung the candidate reaches and what would move it up.

1. **The model uses signal X.** Ablation, probing, perturbation, occlusion
   with proper controls. Comparatively easy.
2. **X is not an artifact.** Not scanner, site, protocol, reconstruction,
   position, dose, habitus, referral pattern, or label leakage. This is the
   validity gate — necessary, and where most projects quietly fail.
3. **X is a named, human-legible thing.** The deliverable sentence.

Rung 2 is a **gate, not a destination.** A study that only eliminates
confounds tells a physician what the model is *not* doing, which does not help
them understand a decision. Confound elimination earns the right to make the
rung-3 claim; it is not the claim.

A candidate that can reach only rung 2 is allowed, but must say so and must
name what would be needed to reach rung 3. A candidate that reaches rung 1 and
asserts rung 3 is the standard failure of this literature.

### The hard constraint on X

**X must be independently measurable without a human annotator.**

This is the constraint that makes the program feasible for you, and it is not
optional. Six prior candidates died because they required knowing what a human
saw when they assigned a label, and that was undocumented, unavailable, or
contaminated. Do not walk back into that.

X qualifies if it can be computed from the image by an existing, citable tool
or a well-defined measurement. Examples of the right shape:

- parenchymal texture statistics, emphysema percentage, density histograms
- vessel blood volume by calibre, airway wall thickness, luminal area
- muscle or fat attenuation in Hounsfield units, sarcopenia indices
- cardiac chamber size, aortic diameter, coronary calcium
- bone mineral density, vertebral morphometry
- organ volumes from an off-the-shelf segmentation tool

X does **not** qualify if establishing it requires a radiologist to look at
images and agree, or if it exists only as a rating in a dataset whose
annotation conditions are undocumented.

The test: *could you compute X on a scan the model has never seen, today,
without asking anyone?* If not, pick a different X.

This constraint is what separates a concept the model found from a concept you
asserted.

### The two precedents to hold in mind

- Retinal fundus photographs predict patient sex at near-ceiling accuracy while
  ophthalmologists are at chance (Poplin et al. 2018). Real signal, previously
  unarticulated, and it opened a line of work. Related: histopathology slides
  predicting driver mutations, ECG predicting ventricular dysfunction.
- Chest radiographs predict self-reported race across modalities and
  preprocessing, robustly, and after years of investigation nobody can say what
  the signal is (Gichoya et al. 2022). Real, reproducible, and not a discovery.

Both are true. The difference between them is rung 2.

## Two entry points, both allowed

### Entry point 1 — a known gap

Start from a documented case where a model beats human readers, or predicts
something readers cannot. The gap is the evidence that signal exists; the
question is what it is. More grounded, easier to verify, less likely to be
vapor.

### Entry point 2 — looking for the unexpected

Start from a model that merely performs well and ask what it is using that
nobody expected. No documented gap to anchor on. This is where genuinely novel
findings would come from, and also where unfalsifiable speculation comes from.

Entry point 2 candidates carry a higher burden: name the specific measurement
that would detect the unexpected signal, and the specific artifact it would be
confused with. "Probe the representation and see what's there" is not a design.

## Search modes

Each candidate declares `search_mode`.

- **Mode A — the unfinished story.** A paper stops one experiment short.
  Citation-anchored: strong evidence, limited imagination. It can only surface
  questions the literature already framed, and it selects for gaps authors
  chose to leave — sometimes because the data to close them does not exist.
- **Mode B — the unasked question.** Nobody framed it. Found in the space
  between two things that should connect and do not. What would you check if
  you did not trust this result, and why has nobody published that check?
- **Mode C — speculative.** Explicitly permitted to be unlikely. Lower bar on
  feasibility and prior work; **higher** bar on mechanism. A Mode C candidate
  must name the physical or biological quantity it thinks the model is using,
  and the measurement that would show it. Cross-domain borrowing belongs here.

Per cycle: **1 Mode A, 2 Mode B, 2 Mode C.** Five candidates.

Mode C candidates are scored on interest, novelty, and mechanism clarity rather
than feasibility. Do not demote a Mode C candidate for being hard. Do demote it
for being untestable.

## Guard against fluent nonsense

The characteristic failure of speculative generation is a connection that reads
beautifully and implies no measurement. Free energy and diagnostic uncertainty.
Sparse coding and concept bottlenecks. Predictive processing and radiologist
priors. These produce excellent sentences and no experiment.

Every cross-domain or speculative candidate must answer:

**What would be different if the analogy were dropped?**

If the answer is "nothing" — if you would run the same code either way — the
analogy is decoration. Rewrite without it or discard.

## Learn from the record

`evidence/decisions.md` is injected into your context. It is the accumulated
record of what has been proposed, critiqued, and killed, with reasons.

**Read it before proposing, and state explicitly for each candidate whether it
dies the same way as a prior candidate.**

The dominant failure so far, five of six kills, is **annotation provenance**:
the study depended on knowing who assigned the labels and what they could see,
and that was undocumented, unavailable, or contaminated by peer exposure.
Specifically:

- LIDC diagnosis file: patient-level, numbering inconsistent with the XML, only
  18 nodules reliably linkable.
- Derm7pt: whether checklist annotators saw the clinical photograph is
  undocumented, making cross-modality results ambiguous.
- BUS-BRA: releases BI-RADS assessment categories, not lexicon descriptors —
  there were no concepts to intervene on.
- LIDC semantic ratings: released reads are from the unblinded phase after
  readers saw each other's marks, and reader IDs are not stable across scans,
  so they are not independent measurement methods.

The one candidate that survived did so by **not requiring labels at all** in
its primary readout — comparing a model to itself across two reconstructions of
identical anatomy. That structural move is available more often than it is
used. Look for it.

Required per candidate: `dies_like_prior` — either the prior candidate it
resembles and why this one is different, or an explicit "no prior failure mode
applies, because…"

## The keystone prerequisite

Name the single fact which, if false, makes the study impossible or
uninterpretable. State whether it has been **directly inspected** — the actual
file, table, schema, or methods section — or merely inferred from a collection
page, abstract, or search summary.

`feasibility` and `novelty_confidence` are capped at 3 unless
`keystone_status` is `INSPECTED_TRUE`. Mode C candidates may honestly report
`NOT_INSPECTED` and accept the cap; that is expected and not a defect.

**The wrong-keystone error has now occurred three times.** It is the dominant
failure of this loop, ahead of annotation provenance. In each case the easy
adjacent fact was verified and the load-bearing one assumed:

- idea 005: verified that multiple opinions exist per lesion (true); needed
  that they are independent measurement methods (false).
- idea 006: verified that exterior voxels survive preprocessing (true); needed
  that a body-excluded volume is in-distribution (unverified, and probably
  false).

Procedure, mandatory: write the keystone, then write the sentence *"if I have
only verified the nearest checkable thing, what am I still assuming?"* and
answer it. If the answer is load-bearing, that is the real keystone.

Watch for the same error: "Multiple opinions exist
per lesion" was inspected true. "Those opinions constitute independent
measurement methods" was the real keystone, and it was false. State the keystone
as the thing your inference needs, not the thing that is easy to check.

## Claim identifiability

Can the design distinguish the claimed explanation from the plausible
alternatives? A compelling headline is not identifiability. List the two or
three most plausible alternative explanations for a positive result and say
which ones the design rules out.

For this program specifically, the standing alternatives are: scanner or
vendor, acquisition protocol, reconstruction, site, patient positioning, body
habitus, disease prevalence in the sampled population, referral pathway, and
label leakage from the report. Address them by name.

## Negative results

Classify the anticipated negative:

1. **Decisive** — meaningfully weakens the hypothesis.
2. **Sensitivity-limited** — may reflect power, modelling, or metric choice;
   needs an equivalence margin or minimum-detectable-effect.
3. **Uninterpretable** — several explanations survive.

Only type 1 counts toward negative-result value. Non-rejection is not evidence
of independence.

## Domain focus

**Radiology, with emphasis on CT and 3D volumetric imaging.** Vascular and
tubular anatomy, chest CT, and CT-report paired corpora are especially
relevant. Retinal, ECG, and pathology precedents may be cited as motivation but
the experiment should land in radiology where possible.

Per cycle: at least three of five candidates in radiology or CT. At most one
dermatology candidate. No more than two on any single dataset.

## Constraints

- Compute: Colab Pro+ or equivalent single-GPU sessions.
- No dependence on unconfirmed DUA-gated data.
- No large-scale radiologist annotation campaign.
- Literature claims require primary-source verification.
- Keep confirmatory and exploratory work separate.
- Never tune on the untouched test set.
- Prefer designs whose primary readout does not depend on label quality.

## What counts as success

- A clear positive result.
- A decisive negative — including "the signal was an artifact."
- Evidence that a popular assumption is unsupported.
- Identification of a decisive confound.
- A feasibility result that prevents wasted effort.


===== docs/COLLABORATOR_RULES.md =====
# Collaborator rules

## Role

Act as a critical research collaborator. Generate ideas, but spend at least as much effort trying to disprove or simplify them.

## Required distinctions

Always distinguish:

- verified fact;
- source-supported interpretation;
- inference;
- speculation;
- exploratory result;
- confirmatory result.

## Literature

- Use primary sources for medical, dataset, and method claims.
- Record DOI, PMID, arXiv ID, or official repository URL.
- Never claim novelty from memory alone.
- “I did not find it” is not proof that it does not exist.
- Identify the closest work and explain the exact delta.

## Idea generation

Prefer “one experiment away from a stronger story” over unconstrained novelty brainstorming.

For every idea, identify:

- the scientific uncertainty;
- the existing legwork already completed by others;
- the missing final step;
- why that step matters;
- the smallest decisive experiment;
- the most dangerous confound;
- why a negative result remains useful.

## Coding gate

Do not generate probe code until all are present:

- a reviewed idea card;
- a feasibility memo;
- a probe contract;
- explicit human approval.

## Experimental integrity

- Freeze splits before model comparison.
- Save configurations, seeds, environment, and per-case outputs.
- Use validation for development and preserve an untouched test set.
- Do not reinterpret an invalid run as a negative result.
- Report every authorized variant, not only the best one.
- Stop when the preregistered question is answered or the budget is exhausted.


===== docs/SCORING_RUBRIC.md =====
# Idea scoring rubric

Score each dimension 1-5. Explain every score.

| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clarity | vague | testable with refinement | one-sentence precise question |
| **Identifiability** | a positive result has many explanations | design rules out the main alternative | design isolates the claimed mechanism |
| Medical relevance | cosmetic | plausible utility | clear meaningful consequence |
| Interest | routine | useful niche result | surprising or broadly compelling |
| Prior legwork | little exists | some reusable assets | data/code/labels/checkpoints ready |
| Feasibility | major barriers | manageable | first result in days |
| Data readiness | uncertain/restricted | accessible with work | public and directly usable |
| Evaluation readiness | unclear | custom metrics needed | accepted metrics and baselines exist |
| Negative-result value | uninterpretable null | sensitivity-limited null | decisive negative |
| Novelty confidence | likely covered | uncertain | precise verified gap |
| Regret | little concern | worth considering | obvious-in-hindsight opportunity |

## Hard caps

`feasibility` and `novelty_confidence` may not exceed **3** unless
`keystone_status` is `INSPECTED_TRUE`. See the charter.

`negative_result_value` may not exceed **2** if the anticipated negative is
classified as uninterpretable.

## Priority score

Transparent weighted sum, not a fake probability:

- 20% feasibility
- **15% identifiability**
- 15% medical relevance
- 10% prior legwork
- 10% interest
- 10% clarity
- 10% negative-result value
- 5% data readiness
- 5% novelty confidence

Evaluation readiness and regret are reported separately and must not override
weak scientific value.

Identifiability enters at 15% because the first cycle produced several
candidates with strong headlines whose designs could not isolate the stated
phenomenon. Interest was compensating for weak measurement validity.

## Mode C scoring

Mode C (speculative) candidates are scored differently. Do **not** demote a
Mode C candidate for low feasibility or thin prior legwork — that is what the
mode is for. Do demote it for being untestable.

For Mode C, replace the priority weighting with:

- 30% mechanism clarity (is the suspected physical/biological signal named?)
- 25% identifiability
- 20% interest
- 15% medical relevance
- 10% clarity

Report feasibility and novelty confidence for information, outside the score.
A Mode C candidate that would take three weeks is fine. One that could not be
falsified in three years is not.

**Mechanism clarity, 1-5:**

| 1 | 3 | 5 |
|---|---|---|
| "probe the representation and see what is there" | a named signal family, unclear how to isolate it | a specific physical or biological quantity, and the measurement that would show the model uses it |

**Revisit trigger:**

## 2026-08-04 — Idea 001 REJECTED (LIDC concepts vs diagnosis)
Zinovev et al. 2012, J Digit Imaging 25:423-436 (DOI 10.1007/s10278-011-9445-3)
VERIFIED by reading the paper: diagnosis file is patient-level, numbering
inconsistent with LIDC XML, only 18 nodules reliably linked (8 mal / 9 ben /
1 indet) via single-nodule-patient restriction. Too small for the proposed
paired AUC analysis.
Reopen only with a released, independently validated diagnosis-to-XML-nodule
mapping retaining all eight semantic ratings, meeting a prespecified CI-width
target before model fitting.
Separate unresolved objection, raised in critique but never debated: the eight
characteristics and the malignancy rating come from the same reader in the same
session, so concept-to-suspicion prediction measures rating-form consistency,
not concept validity.

## 2026-08-04 - Idea 004 Stage 0 COMPLETE
3,039 validation volumes / 1,564 scans / 1,304 patients.
1,432 of 1,564 scans multi-reconstruction (92%).
425 strictly clean geometry-matched kernel pairs after excluding slice-count,
position, and acquisition-parameter drift.
Contrasts: Br40f|Br60f 237, Bl56f|Br40f 126, Bl57d|Br36d 58, Br40f|Br44f 4.
462/464 Siemens - findings vendor-specific, state as limitation.
Labels identical across reconstructions: 1.00 (exact duplication).
No released per-volume ClassFine scores: CT-RATE has only RadBERT report
labels; CT-CLIP GitHub v1.0.0 has no release assets; checkpoints are not on
the authors HF account. Inference must be run locally.
Scope: download 850 volumes (425 pairs), not 3,039. Inference code exists at
scripts/data_inference_nii.py and run_forward_data.py.

## 2026-08-04 - Idea 002 PAUSE (Derm7pt clinical photo concepts)
Annotation provenance undocumented: unknown whether checklist annotators saw
the paired clinical photograph. A positive result would have two materially
different explanations. Unblocked only by author correspondence.

## 2026-08-04 - Idea 003 REJECT (BI-RADS intervention realism)
BUS-BRA releases BI-RADS assessment categories, not lexicon descriptors - no
concepts to intervene on. Debate ran six rounds; amendments achieved
feasibility by abandoning the intervention question entirely.

## 2026-08-04 - Idea 005 PAUSE (LIDC concept discriminant validity)
MTMM requires independent measurement methods. LIDC released reads are from the
unblinded phase after readers saw each others marks, and reader IDs are not
stable across scans. Keystone error: verified that multiple opinions exist
(true) rather than that they are independent measurement methods (false).

## 2026-08-05 - Idea 006 PAUSE (CT-CLIP non-tissue voxel prediction)
Patient-deletion is an extreme OOD intervention; neither direction identifies
exterior reliance during intact inference. Wrong-keystone error, third
occurrence: verified that exterior voxels survive preprocessing (true) when the
inference required that a body-excluded volume is in-distribution (unverified).
Reopening condition: inspect CT-CLIP training loader for large-region masking
or cutout with matching fill value.
SPIN-OFF, endorsed by both critique and debate: hold every voxel inside a
dilated patient contour fixed and substitute only the scan exterior between
geometry-matched scans; measure paired ClassFine score change. Separate
estimand, enter as a new candidate.

## 2026-08-05 - Idea 007 ADVANCE TO REVISION (lung inflation, CT-CLIP)
Paired inhale/exhale BHCT + 4DCT confirmed: 20 patients, one session, one
scanner, TCIA DOI 10.7937/3ppx-7s22, ungated, 14.93 GB.
4DCT phases are NOT calibrated inflation levels - phase is time position, not
fraction of vital capacity; same amplitude occurs on both limbs; phase-sorting
artifacts. Dose-response arm demoted to exploratory.
Preprocessing confound is the live keystone residual: fixed-size crop may admit
different anatomy at different diaphragm positions. Stage 0 gate.
CT-CLIP has no mosaic attenuation head - card claimed a nonexistent output.
Claim demoted rung 3 -> rung 1: sensitivity to respiratory state, not
identification of total lung volume as the cue.

# Portfolio brief (auto-generated; run `python scout.py brief`)

Actionable ideas with debate verdicts. A revival/recombination
candidate MUST cite the specific condition below that has changed.

## idea-013 [SHORTLISTED] -- CT-CLIP has two calcification labels - coronary and arterial - so it can be asked whether it localises calcium or just sees hyperdensity

**Verdict:** **REVISE.** Rewrite the idea card around the reduced rung-1 calibration and reconstruction-sensitivity audit, with localisation explicitly excluded and the keystone set to `NOT_INSPECTED`. The single most important thing for the human to inspect before deciding is whether a validated, annotation-free coronary target localiser for nongated noncontrast CT actually exists and runs on CT-RATE; that fact determines whether the high-value localisation question has a credible spin-off or whether idea 013 should remain only a modest robustness audit.

**Unresolved:** Is the reduced rung-1 audit worth running?; Can the localisation question be revived as a separate intervention study?; Would validated synthetic edits identify calcium location rather than edit artifacts?

## idea-012 [PAUSED] -- Two papers say Sybil's residual is the background and name emphysema; neither measured the heart calcium sitting in the same scan

**Verdict:** **PAUSE.** Before deciding otherwise, the human should inspect whether the MD.ai-derived scan-level exclusion membership has become available—and is joinable to a frozen obtainable Sybil evaluation split—because without it the study cannot test the specific residual that defines Idea 012.

## idea-011 [PAUSED] -- Forensic anthropologists age a skeleton by its rib cartilage - ask whether an unguided CT model found the same clock

**Verdict:** **PAUSE.** The debate converged after a real, persistent objection; this was not a one-round rubber stamp. Before deciding whether to reopen, the human should look first for the missing identification instrument: a confirmed human chest CT resource with retained spectral base-material or dual-kV raw data and linkable age that can provide a measured, post-preprocessing-matched mineralized-to-soft-tissue contrast. Without that—or another genuinely matched real-tissue control—the current experiment cannot distinguish native use of costal cartilage mineralization from response to the deletion operation, regardless of improvements to masks, models, or supervision audits.

**Unresolved:** Can a measured, properly matched control separate mineralization use from the deletion signature?; Could registered longitudinal CT provide a natural contrast?; Is the editable cartilage mask sufficiently precise in the population where the experiment would run?; Are the other Stage-0 assets actually available and clean?

## idea-009 [ACTIVE] -- Murray's cube law says how a branching tree should be built - ask whether the risk model is reading the lung's departure from it

**Verdict:** **REJECT.** Before deciding, the human should look most closely at the estimand mismatch: neither association with a computable vascular phenotype nor sensitivity to synthetic vessel deletion identifies reliance on naturally occurring pruning and Murray-exponent departure. Revisit only if a dataset and validated design can isolate natural within-patient BV5 and exponent variation from acquisition and parenchymal change, with adequate exponent repeatability and a model-reliance test tied to that variation.

## idea-008 [ACTIVE] -- Two papers say Sybil's residual signal is the background, one of them names emphysema, and neither measured it

**Verdict:** **REVISE.** The debate produced a coherent conditional design, but the current `idea_card.json` still describes the superseded reconstruction arm, rung-3 observational logic, `INSPECTED_TRUE` keystone, and obsolete scores. Before deciding whether to advance, the human should look most closely at whether the proposed tissue-for-tissue edit can be validated as in-distribution with a prespecified sham-effect tolerance; that is now the single fact separating a model-use study from an association-only study.

**Unresolved:** Are the local parenchymal substitutions in-distribution for Sybil?; Does a score response isolate CT-emphysema geometry from remaining visible correlates?; Can the required held-out NLST cohort and covariates actually be recovered?

## idea-007 [ACTIVE] -- The same patient, twice, ten minutes apart, differing only in how much air is in the lungs

**Verdict:** **REVISE.** Update the idea card to the converged state-level claim and corrected scores, then require Stage 0 before a probe contract. The single most important thing for the human to inspect is the prespecified DICOM-to-final-tensor comparability gate: whether enough inhale/exhale pairs truly retain matched reconstruction, coordinates, physical scale, and thoracic coverage through the complete pinned CT-CLIP preprocessing pipeline.

**Unresolved:** Do enough actual pairs pass the reconstruction and framing gate?; Is a common physical box compatible with CT-CLIP preprocessing without state-dependent framing?; Is the optional matched-volume 4DCT jitter floor usable?

## idea-006 [PAUSED] -- Ask the chest-CT foundation model to diagnose a volume with no patient in it

**Verdict:** **PAUSE.** Before deciding whether the pause is reversible, the human should inspect the official CT-CLIP training data loader and augmentation configuration for large-region masking or cutout with a matching fill value. Absence would make the original intervention indefensible for this checkpoint; presence would justify distributional validation, not automatic advancement.

**Unresolved:** Did CT-CLIP training make large constant-filled occlusions sufficiently familiar?; Could the original question be valid for a different chest-CT model?

## idea-005 [PAUSED] -- Eight named characteristics, or three latent ones? Discriminant validity of the LIDC concept vocabulary

**Verdict:** **REJECT** the original idea as currently framed. The single most important thing for the human to inspect is whether to promote spin-off S2—the direct test of reader-slot exchangeability—into a fresh candidate, because it preserves the cheap public-data audit while avoiding the undefined dimension-count estimand.

**Unresolved:** Can a narrower pairwise latent-correlation audit be scientifically useful?; Can a global partition estimator recover a defensible dimension count?; Are LIDC reader slots empirically exchangeable?

`evidence/ledger_digest.md` is in your context. It is the institutional memory
of every idea this program has tracked: statuses, scrutiny levels, and the

"X is merely correlated with the label."

- A revival/recombination must set `parent_ids` (e.g. ["idea-012"]) and a
  `revival_basis`: quote the specific blocking condition or objection from the
  brief, then state the NEW fact that changes it, with a checkable source
  (a release, a paper, a newly available asset). No new fact, no revival --
  re-proposing an idea against an unchanged objection is forbidden.
- A recombination crosses parts of two entries (e.g. a paused idea's question
  with another idea's validated measurement); it must name both parents and
  say which part of each survives and why the combination dodges what killed
  or blocked the parents.
- ZERO revivals is the correct number when nothing in the brief has genuinely
  changed. Never manufacture a revival to fill the quota; brand-new questions
  are always the default.

## Keystone evidence rule

Any `keystone_status: INSPECTED_TRUE` claim MUST include a
`keystone_evidence` field quoting the artifact that proves it (URL,
file path, table row, or verbatim excerpt). A bare INSPECTED_TRUE
without evidence is mechanically demoted to NOT_INSPECTED at merge.

## Step 1 — Generate ten questions before developing any of them

Write ten one-line research questions. Do not elaborate. Do not score. Do not
check feasibility yet.

The point of this step is to search a wider space than you would if you were
optimizing a complete idea card from the first sentence. Cards written
end-to-end select for ideas that were safe by sentence two.

**Every question must be answerable with a sentence of the form "the model is
using X."** Not "the model is not using the scanner." A question whose best
possible answer is the absence of a confound is not eligible this cycle — write
a different one.

X must be computable from an image today, by an existing tool or a well-defined
measurement, without a human annotator. See the charter's hard constraint.

Include in the ten:
- questions you suspect are too hard
- questions you are not sure are answerable
- at least two that connect medical imaging to a field outside it
- at least one that sounds obviously wrong but that you cannot immediately
  refute
- at least three where X is a quantity a radiologist already has a word for

Then pick **five** to develop. Pick on interest and mechanism clarity, not on
how defensible they will be. The critic exists to handle the rest.

Record all ten in `all_questions`, and for the five you dropped, one line each
on why.

## Step 2 — Mode and entry-point quotas

Of the five developed candidates:

- **1 Mode A** (unfinished story)
- **2 Mode B** (unasked question)
- **2 Mode C** (speculative — lower feasibility bar, higher mechanism bar)

At least three of five in radiology or CT. At most one dermatology.
No more than two on any single dataset.

Each candidate also declares `entry_point`:
- `1` — starts from a documented model-beats-human gap
- `2` — starts from a well-performing model, looking for unexpected signal

Both are allowed. Entry point 2 requires naming the specific measurement that
would detect the unexpected signal and the specific artifact it would be
confused with.

If you cannot fill a quota with something you believe in, say so in
`quota_note`. An honest short list beats a padded one.

## Step 3 — Read the record first

`evidence/decisions.md` is in your context. Read it before developing anything.

For every candidate, fill `dies_like_prior`: name the prior killed candidate it
most resembles and say what makes this one different, or state plainly that no
prior failure mode applies and why.

The dominant prior failure is annotation provenance — the study needed to know
who assigned labels and what they could see, and that was undocumented or
contaminated. If your candidate's keystone depends on annotation conditions,
say so directly rather than discovering it in critique.

## Step 4 — Keystone, checked before scoring

Name `keystone_prerequisite`: the single fact which, if false, makes the study
impossible or uninterpretable.

State it as the thing your *inference* needs, not the thing that is easy to
check. A prior candidate verified "multiple opinions exist per lesion" (true)
when the real keystone was "those opinions are independent measurement
methods" (false). That error cost a full critique and debate cycle.

Then go and check it — the actual file listing, data dictionary, schema, or
methods section. Not the collection homepage. Not an abstract.

`keystone_status`: `INSPECTED_TRUE` / `INSPECTED_FALSE` / `NOT_INSPECTED`.

`feasibility` and `novelty_confidence` cap at 3 unless `INSPECTED_TRUE`.
Mode C candidates may honestly report `NOT_INSPECTED`; that is expected.

## Step 5 — Per candidate, write

1. `search_mode`, `entry_point`, `title`
2. `question` — one sentence, ending in a question mark
3. `rung` — 1, 2, or 3 per the charter, and what would move it up
4. `deliverable_sentence` — the single sentence a radiologist could agree or
   disagree with, of the form "the model is using X." Write it now, before the
   design. If you cannot write it, the candidate is not eligible.
5. `X_measurement` — how X is computed from an image, naming the tool or
   formula, and a citation if one exists. Then answer: *could I compute X on a
   scan the model has never seen, today, without asking anyone?* If no, the
   candidate is ineligible regardless of how interesting it is.
6. `suspected_signal` — the physical or biological mechanism by which X would
   be present in the image. Required for Mode C. "Some feature" is not an
   answer.
7. `keystone_prerequisite`, `keystone_status`, `keystone_evidence`
8. `keystone_residual_assumption` — having verified the nearest checkable
   thing, what are you still assuming? If that assumption is load-bearing, it
   is the real keystone. This error has occurred three times; see the charter.
9. `rung_reached` — 1, 2, or 3, and what would move it up
10. `dies_like_prior`
11. `closest_prior_work` with identifiers, and what it did not do
12. `existing_assets`
13. `smallest_decisive_experiment`
14. `standing_confounds_addressed` — scanner, vendor, protocol, reconstruction,
    site, positioning, habitus, prevalence, referral pathway, label leakage.
    Name which the design rules out and which it does not.
15. `alternative_explanations` and which the design excludes
16. `anticipated_negative` — decisive / sensitivity-limited / uninterpretable
17. `cross_domain` if applicable: borrowed construct, the measurement it
    implies, and **what would change if the analogy were dropped**
18. `remaining_legwork` — time to first decision, not just what exists
19. `scores` per the rubric, including `identifiability`
20. `unverified_claims`

## What went wrong last cycle, and what to do differently

All ten questions last cycle were confound-elimination: does the model read
the dose, the scanner, the table, the motion artifact. Those are good
questions and they are not this program. Their best possible answer is the
*absence* of an explanation, which does not help a physician understand a
decision.

Confound elimination is the validity gate that earns the right to say "the
model is using X." It is not X.

This cycle, lead with X. Ask what a physician would want to hear, then work
backwards to what would make it credible.

## Style

Prefer designs whose primary readout does not need trustworthy labels. The one
candidate that has survived this loop compared a model to itself across two
reconstructions of the same anatomy — no ground truth entered the primary
measurement. That structural move is available more often than it is used.

Be suspicious of your own good sentences. If a candidate's appeal is mostly in
how it sounds, say so in `alternative_explanations` and score identifiability
accordingly.

Write `scout_candidates.json`. Do not write code.
