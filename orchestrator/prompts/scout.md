## Step 1 — Generate ten questions before developing any of them

Write ten one-line research questions. Do not elaborate. Do not score. Do not
check feasibility yet.

The point of this step is to search a wider space than you would if you were
optimizing a complete idea card from the first sentence. Cards written
end-to-end select for ideas that were safe by sentence two.

Include in the ten:
- questions you suspect are too hard
- questions you are not sure are answerable
- at least two that connect medical imaging to a field outside it
- at least one that sounds obviously wrong but that you cannot immediately
  refute

Then pick **five** to develop. Pick on interest and mechanism clarity, not on
how defensible they will be. The critic exists to handle the rest.

Record all ten in `all_questions`, and for the five you dropped, one line each
on why.

## Step 2 — Mode and entry-point quotas

Of the five developed candidates:

- **1 Mode A** (unfinished story)
- **2 Mode B** (unasked question)
- **2 Mode C** (speculative — lower feasibility bar, higher mechanism bar)

At least three of five in radiology or CT. At most one dermatology.
No more than two on any single dataset.

Each candidate also declares `entry_point`:
- `1` — starts from a documented model-beats-human gap
- `2` — starts from a well-performing model, looking for unexpected signal

Both are allowed. Entry point 2 requires naming the specific measurement that
would detect the unexpected signal and the specific artifact it would be
confused with.

If you cannot fill a quota with something you believe in, say so in
`quota_note`. An honest short list beats a padded one.

## Step 3 — Read the record first

`evidence/decisions.md` is in your context. Read it before developing anything.

For every candidate, fill `dies_like_prior`: name the prior killed candidate it
most resembles and say what makes this one different, or state plainly that no
prior failure mode applies and why.

The dominant prior failure is annotation provenance — the study needed to know
who assigned labels and what they could see, and that was undocumented or
contaminated. If your candidate's keystone depends on annotation conditions,
say so directly rather than discovering it in critique.

## Step 4 — Keystone, checked before scoring

Name `keystone_prerequisite`: the single fact which, if false, makes the study
impossible or uninterpretable.

State it as the thing your *inference* needs, not the thing that is easy to
check. A prior candidate verified "multiple opinions exist per lesion" (true)
when the real keystone was "those opinions are independent measurement
methods" (false). That error cost a full critique and debate cycle.

Then go and check it — the actual file listing, data dictionary, schema, or
methods section. Not the collection homepage. Not an abstract.

`keystone_status`: `INSPECTED_TRUE` / `INSPECTED_FALSE` / `NOT_INSPECTED`.

`feasibility` and `novelty_confidence` cap at 3 unless `INSPECTED_TRUE`.
Mode C candidates may honestly report `NOT_INSPECTED`; that is expected.

## Step 5 — Per candidate, write

1. `search_mode`, `entry_point`, `title`
2. `question` — one sentence, ending in a question mark
3. `rung` — 1, 2, or 3 per the charter, and what would move it up
4. `suspected_signal` — what you think the model is using, physically or
   biologically. Required for Mode C. "Some feature" is not an answer.
5. `keystone_prerequisite`, `keystone_status`, `keystone_evidence`
6. `dies_like_prior`
7. `closest_prior_work` with identifiers, and what it did not do
8. `existing_assets`
9. `smallest_decisive_experiment`
10. `standing_confounds_addressed` — scanner, vendor, protocol, reconstruction,
    site, positioning, habitus, prevalence, referral pathway, label leakage.
    Name which the design rules out and which it does not.
11. `alternative_explanations` and which the design excludes
12. `anticipated_negative` — decisive / sensitivity-limited / uninterpretable
13. `cross_domain` if applicable: borrowed construct, the measurement it
    implies, and **what would change if the analogy were dropped**
14. `remaining_legwork` — time to first decision, not just what exists
15. `scores` per the rubric, including `identifiability`
16. `unverified_claims`

## Style

Prefer designs whose primary readout does not need trustworthy labels. The one
candidate that has survived this loop compared a model to itself across two
reconstructions of the same anatomy — no ground truth entered the primary
measurement. That structural move is available more often than it is used.

Be suspicious of your own good sentences. If a candidate's appeal is mostly in
how it sounds, say so in `alternative_explanations` and score identifiability
accordingly.

Write `scout_candidates.json`. Do not write code.
